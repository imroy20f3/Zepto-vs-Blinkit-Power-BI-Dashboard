# Zepto-vs-Blinkit-Power-BI-Dashboard
This project presents a comparative analysis of Zepto and Blinkit using an interactive Power BI dashboard. The goal is to understand sales performance, customer behavior, and operational metrics across multiple dimensions such as time, category, city, and payment mode.
This dashboard is designed to simulate a real-world business scenario where stakeholders can quickly compare two quick-commerce platforms and make data-driven decisions related to sales growth, customer experience, and operational efficiency.
